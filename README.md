# Estimate of Opioid Impact

Over the past two decades, the United States has seen a tremendous increase in the use and
abuse of prescription opioids, leading not only to a huge rise in opioid addiction, but also a
rise in prescription overdose deaths, and increasingly deaths from non-prescription opioids
like heroin and fentanyl as people who became addicted to opioids due to prescriptions
turn to illegal markets to sustain their addiction.

In this project, weâ€™ll be estimating the effectiveness of policy interventions designed
to limit the over-prescription of opioids. More specifically, we will attempt to measure the
effect of a series of policy changes designed to limited opioid abuse in several US states
on (a) opioid drug prescriptions, and (b) mortality from drug overdoses.
